# Pi Hi/Low Game

You begin with "3.14" and you guess whether the next digit in the decimal expansion of pi is greater than, equal to, or less than the previous digit in the expansion by pressing, A, B, or C, respectively on the OLED Feather Wing.

The game always shows you four digits (or three digits and the decimal point in the beginning) so you don't get lost.

A correct guess increases your score by 1 point, and an incorrect guess causes a point to be lost.
